# edt-project
Source code for the EDT Project Drone.



The source files are in edt_project/
To open the project in the Arduino Editor, just open one of the .ino files

Yes, the project structure is bad but so is the Arduino IDE so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.



Also, the old g++ that the Arduino IDE struggles with constexprs so #defines had to be used.



Libraries used:

- Adafruit_MPU6050
- Adafruit_BusIO
- Wire
- SPI
- Adafruit_Unified_Sensor
- Servo
